# Belly-Button-Biodiversity
Challenge 12 and Exercises for UT Bootcamp

## Overview
The folders labeled Exercise01 through Exercise05 hold the index.html and JavaScript files for exercises within Module 12 that are not directly related to the Challenge. The files in the `Module12_Challenge` folder are for the Module 12 Challenge Assignment.

## Repository Purpose
The purpose of the repository is to house files for a webpage dashboard that shows data from the Bellybutton Bacteria study. 

## Project Description
The webpage dashboard loads the json data from `samples.json` and shows four charts relating to that participant's bellybutton bacteria information.  Demographics for the person are on the left. 
- Deliverable 1 is the horizontal bar chart. 
- Deliverable 2 is the bubble chart at the bottom. 
- Deliverable 3 is the gauge chart on the right. 
- Deliverable 4 consists of three customizations to the html of the webpage: adding a background image, changing the jumbotron text to white, and changing the background color of the webpage to a light blue.
